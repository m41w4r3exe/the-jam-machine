# The-Jam-Machine - a Generative AI composing MIDI music

*This project is still under development*.

## Summary

The-Jam-Machine is a source of inspiration for beginner or more proficient musicians. Based on a GPT (Generative Pretrained-Transformer) architecture, and trained on the text transcriptions of about 5000 MIDI songs, it can generate harmonious MIDI sequences.

You can check the App on [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/spaces/JammyMachina/the-jam-machine-app), with which you can generate 8 bars of downloadable MIDI music with up to 3 instruments playing in harmony.
