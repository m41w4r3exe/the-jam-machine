# The-Jam-Machine

This project is still under development.

## The-Jam-Machine dreams up techno music compositions through deep neural hallucinations

The-Jam-Machine is a Generative AI trained on text transcription of MIDI music and is meant to be used as a source of inspiration for beginners or more proficient musicians. It uses a GPT (Generative Pretrained-Transformer) architecture, and has been trained on about 5000 midi songs.

### Demo app on [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/spaces/JammyMachina/the-jam-machine-app)

The app hosted on HuggingFace is just a simple demo of what the AI can do. \
It can generate up to 3 instruments and 8 bars of music, and you can download the generated MIDI file.
