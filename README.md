# The-Jam-Machine
This project is still under development.

## The-Jam-Machine dreams up techno music compositions through deep neural hallucinations.

The-Jam-Machine is a Generative AI trained on text transcription of MIDI music, meant to enhance creativity while making computer music. It uses a GPT2 model architexture and has been trained on about 5000 midi songs.
Just import the raw inspiration into your favorite DAW using the generated MIDI file to finish producing your original tracks.

## There is a demo app on [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/spaces/JammyMachina/the-jam-machine-app) 
The app hosted on HuggingFace is just a simple demo of what the model can do. \
It is and will most likely always be limited to 3 instruments and 8 bars of music.
